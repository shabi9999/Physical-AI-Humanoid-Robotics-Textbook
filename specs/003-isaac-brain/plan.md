# Implementation Plan: Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Branch**: `003-isaac-brain` | **Date**: 2025-12-08 | **Spec**: [specs/003-isaac-brain/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-isaac-brain/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by the `/sp.plan` workflow and defines the research, design, and architecture for Module 3 content creation.

## Summary

Module 3 teaches advanced perception, localization, and path planning for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technologies. Students will learn how humanoid robots perceive their environment, understand where they are located, and plan safe, efficient paths—using industrial-grade tools (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS VSLAM, Nav2). The technical approach follows a four-chapter structure progressing through simulation → synthetic data → localization → planning, with each chapter independently testable and aligned with NVIDIA Isaac official documentation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (Docusaurus + MDX compatible)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Docusaurus 2.x (static site generation)
- Mermaid (diagrams and workflows)
- React (interactive components)
- OpenAI API (for future RAG chatbot integration)

**Storage**: N/A (content-only module; no runtime storage)
**Testing**: Content validation (clarity, accuracy, consistency, navigation)
**Target Platform**: Web (Docusaurus-deployed to GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Documentation/Educational content (web)
**Performance Goals**:
- Fast page loads (<2s for typical 5000-word chapter)
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet learners
- Accessible to beginner learners (Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12)

**Constraints**:
- No implementation code (Python, C++, YAML)
- Beginner-friendly language (no assumptions of advanced CV/robotics knowledge)
- 100% alignment with NVIDIA Isaac official documentation
- Docusaurus-compatible Markdown with proper heading hierarchy
- Textual/ASCII descriptions only (no embedded images for content portability)

**Scale/Scope**:
- 4 chapters (Isaac Sim, Synthetic Data, VSLAM, Nav2)
- ~5,000 words per chapter (20,000 total)
- 3-5 conceptual diagrams per chapter (textual descriptions or Mermaid)
- Cross-linking to Module 1 content

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| **Modular intelligence via Claude Code Subagents & Skills** | ✅ PASS | Each of 4 chapters independently testable (U1-U4); can be developed/reviewed separately |
| **Docusaurus book standards** | ✅ PASS | 1 of 15+ chapters; includes concepts, diagrams, labs section in plan; deployable to GitHub Pages |
| **RAG Chatbot standards** | ✅ PASS | Content will be chunked (400-800 tokens per spec), indexed for semantic search, with citations |
| **ROS 2 + Isaac Sim + VSLAM + Nav2** | ✅ PASS | Spec explicitly covers NVIDIA Isaac technologies: Isaac Sim, Synthetic Data, Isaac ROS VSLAM, Nav2 |

**GATE RESULT**: ✅ **PASS** — Project aligns with all constitution principles. Ready for Phase 0 research.

### Docusaurus Content Structure (my-website/)

```text
my-website/docs/module3/
├── intro.md                   # Chapter 0: Introduction to Module 3
├── chapter1-isaac-sim.md      # Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Fundamentals (U1)
├── chapter2-synthetic-data.md # Chapter 2: Synthetic Data Generation (U2)
├── chapter3-vslam.md          # Chapter 3: Isaac ROS VSLAM (U3)
└── chapter4-nav2.md           # Chapter 4: Nav2 Path Planning (U4)

my-website/docusaurus.config.js  # Updated sidebar.ts entries for module3
my-website/sidebars.js           # Add module3 chapters to sidebar navigation
```

**Structure Decision**:
- **Docusaurus Location**: Content lives in `my-website/docs/module3/` alongside Module 1 (`docs/module1/`)
- **Sidebar Integration**: `sidebars.js` will include module3 sections under the main navigation
- **Cross-linking**: Each chapter includes links back to relevant Module 1 content (e.g., "review ROS 2 topics" → Module 1)
- **Naming Convention**: `chapterN-topic.md` (matches Module 1 pattern)
- **Metadata**: Each chapter includes YAML frontmatter with learning objectives, prerequisites, and estimated reading time
- **Chunk Size**: Content split into 400-800 token chunks for RAG indexing (follows constitution standards)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Research & Validation (OUTPUT: research.md)

**Objectives**:
1. Verify NVIDIA Isaac documentation accuracy and availability
2. Determine optimal diagram/text balance for beginner learners
3. Define chapter structure and content flow
4. Establish cross-linking strategy with Module 1

**Deliverables**:
- `research.md`: Architecture decisions, diagram patterns, content structure
- Documentation references (NVIDIA Isaac links for verification)
- Chapter outline templates with section counts and word targets

**Success Criteria**:
- All 4 chapters have verified NVIDIA Isaac references
- Diagram patterns defined (Mermaid vs. textual ASCII descriptions)
- Chapter structure agreed (sections, subsections, learning objectives)
- Cross-module integration points identified

---

### Phase 1: Design & Specification (OUTPUT: data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)

**Objectives**:
1. Design content metadata model (chapter frontmatter, section hierarchy)
2. Define chapter acceptance criteria (contracts)
3. Create student learning path (quickstart.md)

**Deliverables**:
- `data-model.md`: YAML frontmatter schema, section metadata, chunk boundaries
- `contracts/chapter-structure.md`: Acceptance criteria for each chapter (U1-U4)
- `quickstart.md`: How to navigate Module 3, learning progression, prerequisites

**Success Criteria**:
- Content structure matches Docusaurus conventions
- All chapters follow consistent frontmatter format
- Student learning path is clear and testable
- Contracts align with user stories (U1-U4)

---

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown (OUTPUT: tasks.md via `/sp.tasks`)

**Objectives**:
1. Create fine-grained tasks for content writing
2. Define acceptance criteria for each task
3. Establish testing and validation procedures

**Deliverables**:
- `tasks.md`: 20-30 testable tasks (5-8 per chapter)
- Each task includes: acceptance criteria, dependencies, estimated scope

**Success Criteria**:
- All 4 chapters fully decomposed into tasks
- Each task is independently testable
- Dependencies between tasks documented
- Task acceptance criteria aligned with functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-023)

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (EXECUTED via `/sp.implement`)

**Objectives**:
1. Write Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Fundamentals (U1, FR-001 through FR-005)
2. Write Chapter 2: Synthetic Data Generation (U2, FR-006 through FR-010)
3. Write Chapter 3: Isaac ROS VSLAM (U3, FR-011 through FR-015)
4. Write Chapter 4: Nav2 Path Planning (U4, FR-016 through FR-020)
5. Integrate into Docusaurus (sidebars.js, cross-links)

**Validation Gates**:
- Clarity: Readable for beginner-intermediate learners (SC-003)
- Accuracy: 100% alignment with NVIDIA Isaac docs (SC-006, FR-022)
- Completeness: All functional requirements addressed (FR-001 through FR-023)
- Navigation: Cross-links to Module 1, proper Markdown hierarchy (SC-007)
- Chunk-ability: Content splits cleanly into 400-800 token chunks for RAG (Constitution RAG standard)

---

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (EXECUTED via `/sp.tasks`)

**Objectives**:
1. Update Docusaurus sidebar configuration
2. Run quality validation (clarity, accuracy, consistency)
3. Test navigation and cross-linking
4. Index content for RAG chatbot

**Validation**:
- Docusaurus build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- Content renders without Markdown errors
- Navigation works (links resolve correctly)
- RAG chunking produces valid 400-800 token chunks
- All success criteria met (SC-001 through SC-008)

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **4-chapter structure** | Aligns with user stories (U1-U4) and core NVIDIA Isaac technologies | 3-chapter (merge synthetic data) or 5-chapter (split VSLAM and Nav2) |
| **Docusaurus + MDX** | Consistent with Module 1; static site generation aligns with GitHub Pages deployment | Hugo, MkDocs, custom Next.js site |
| **400-800 token chunks** | Balances context preservation with RAG retrieval accuracy; matches constitution standard | 256 tokens (loses context), 1000 tokens (too broad) |
| **Textual diagrams only** | Ensures content portability (no image dependencies) and accessibility for beginner learners | Embedded PNG/SVG diagrams (larger files, less portable) |
| **NVIDIA docs as source of truth** | Ensures technical accuracy and reproducibility; allows students to verify claims | Original research from papers (harder to verify, less authoritative) |
